### Python

To install python follow this link
[link is yet to come]()

For linux and mac users python comes installed. To check if it is type the following to a terminal

(for you ken everything shoud be fine)
```
python
```
if the above command shows something like..

```
Python 3.10.1 (main, Dec 18 2021, 23:53:45) [GCC 11.1.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

You are good to go. but if by anychance it starts with...
```
python 2.xx.xx (main ....)
```

this shows you are using python 2 and you need 3.5 and above try
```
python3
```
and if that doesnt fix it then ask me for help.


## pip

pip is a python package manager and it can be used to install packages. You need to install it but linux and mac comes with it.
